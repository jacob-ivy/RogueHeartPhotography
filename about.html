         Photographer, wife and mother. I'm married to my best friend (and favorite crossword puzzle partner), and we're raising
         the sweetest boy who's already teaching me new ways to see the world. He's, hands down, the cutest muse I've ever had.
         <br><br>
         I love to photograph the moments you don't notice until you see them frozen in frame. The tender ones, the funny ones, 
         the ones that feel like you.<br><br>
         When I'm not behind the camera, I'm curled up with a good book in a cozy corner of our home, usually with a cat in my lap.
         <br><br>
         Let's make something lovely together.

         Rogue was my dog, my shadow, my constant through every chapter of my life since I was 19. She moved across states with
         me, stayed by my side through career shifts, heartbreaks, celebrations, and the biggest transition of all—the birth of
         my son. Losing her February of 2025 was devastating, and the thought of all the future moments she won’t be here for is
         heartbreaking.<br><br>
         But she will always be part of me. So I’m carrying her forward in the name Rogue Heart Photography. Because she taught
         me about love, loyalty, and the beauty in every fleeting moment. And that’s exactly what I want to capture—those little,
         irreplaceable moments that make up a lifetime.<br><br>
         Here’s to Rogue, always in my heart. And here’s to the stories we’ll tell together.
